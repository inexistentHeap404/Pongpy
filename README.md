Pongpy is inspired from the classic pong game with a slight modulation:
  -> you play on both the sides.
  -> use W (or) S to move the bar on the left side up or down.
  -> use up (or) down arrows to move the bar on the right side up or down


for installation use the classic git clone command.
```
cd pongpy
python3 pong.py
```
